		README for Call Progress Detect
		             Assist Corp.  Li Zhijie, 2006.04.25

File List:
    busy.tone.u : Data file for busy tone(BT)
    dial.tone.u : Data File for Dial Tone(DT)
    ringback.tone.u : Data file for ringback tone(RBT)
    seconddial.tone.u : Data file for second dial tone(SDT)

Binary : tone_make
Source : test_tones_create.c
    Create BT/DT/SDT/RBT tone data file which are used in our algorithm design

Binary : progress    
Source : test_progress_detect.c
    Test out algorithm based on data files created by 'test_tones_create.c'

Binary : progress_fxo
Source : test_progress_fxo.c
    Test Call Progress Tone Detect with a FXO port. A FXO call progress is executed
    with our Call Progress Tone Detect algorithm used in evert step.


Note: 
    With the BT detect algorithm here, the BT detect defined in 'lib/dsp/busy'
    is deprecated.
