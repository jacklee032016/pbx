		README for BT(Busy Tone) Detect
		                       Assist Corp.  Li Zhijie, 2006.03.17

Test Case 1:
     BT Detect algorithm test
     
     put busy and busy.tone.u and run the program, then it will check out BT
     with about 5 seconds' data
     
Test Case 2:
     PBX or Switch BT Detect
     
     Connect FXO port to PBX/Switch, then make a call to our FXO port.
     After 2 ringring, FXO will off-hook.
     Then hang the phone made this call to send BT to FXO port.
     After about 5~12 seconds, our program check out BT and on-hook the 
     FXO port.
     
FAQ:
     Q : How long is it take to detect BT?
     A : It is decided both by out software and PBX/Switch. 
         Delay = delay_of_PBX_send_BT + delay_of_BT Detect.
         
         With our experience, 'NT4D-EXCH' switch, the first term is about 4
         Second. For the second term, our program will check out it about 5 
         seconds After RX BT.
         
         Parameter of our BT algorithm can be tuned as requirement.
         

Note : 
     Now, this is not support. Please use the BT detect algorithm in Call Progress
     Detect.
