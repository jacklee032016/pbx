 * @brief IxAtmdAcc Assert prototypes
 *
 * This header defines the assert features in IxAtmdAcc
 *
 * @note - @a IX_ATMDACC_ENSURE can be disabled in production code :
 *         it is used to detect abnormal situations during integration
 *         steps.
 *
 * @note - @a IX_ATMDACC_ABORT  should redirect to the system-wide
 *        assert mechanism. It is used when no recovery is possible.
 *        (e.g. : a severe error in an interrupt)
 *
 * @note - @a NDEBUG, when not defined, redirect these macros to a
 *        function which display an error message, the stop the
 *        program execution.
